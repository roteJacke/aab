python3.6 Tkinter 2d RPG similar to Mount&amp;Blade (without the battles!)

It is a 2d RPG similar to Mount&Blade without the battle. The player might spend most of their time reading dialogs, like SunlessSea. ~~The deadline of making a functional & playable game is August 14 2018. The deadline for the polishing and adding of content is October 1, 2018.~~ October 1, while October 14 is the deadline for polishing. I have underestimated the time needed and gave an overly optimistic deadline. I/We can add content from time to time then on. Our biggest problem is adding sounds with vanilla Python 3.6, there might be no sounds in this game.

To play the game, just download it from Github, and use Python3. Then just double-click AAB.py

This game is halfway to completion and in need of content and improvement. It's a great learning experience for beginners learning github, python etc... The game only uses the basic version of python3.6, no need to download other modules. The game can be completed within a few months if more people participate. One can add their own quests, items, dialogs, characters, and places and if all is ok, it will be added to the main game. Anyone can contribute. I am also a beginner in Github.


It is in need of a few things to be playable and enjoyable:
- Consisten Art Style!
- story (basic, vengeance, you search for the killers of your wife after regaining your strength)
- more quests / dialogs (nothing profane or nsfw)
- more content
- code quality improvement
- ~~event display system~~
- ~~better quest system~~
- ~~menu screen~~
- ~~save system~~
- code rewrite / improvement! (it was made with cowboy coding)
- ~~ui fix / standardization / improvement~~
